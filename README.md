*Last Updated: April 20, 2025*

## Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Net Worth Telescope respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal and financial data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our multi-currency net worth tracking application.

### Information We Collect

We collect the following information:

* Financial account information accessed through Plaid
* Account balances and transactions
* Investment holdings and performance data
* Currency preferences and exchange rates
* User profile information
* Device information for security purposes

### How We Use Plaid

Our application uses Plaid to connect to your financial institutions. When you connect your accounts through Plaid:

* We receive access tokens but never your actual login credentials
* Information is transmitted using encryption protocols
* We only store the minimum necessary information to provide our services

For more information about how Plaid handles your data, please see Plaid's Privacy Policy at [plaid.com/legal](https://plaid.com/legal).

### Currency Conversion

Our multi-currency features involve:

* Storage of exchange rate data
* Conversion calculations for net worth tracking
* Currency preferences across different accounts
* Display of values in original or base currency
* Support for mixed-currency portfolios

We use secure and reliable exchange rate sources and update rates regularly for accuracy.

### Data Storage

All data is stored securely in our database using industry-standard encryption. Personal and financial information is never sold to third parties. Data is processed only to provide the services you request.

### User Rights

You have the right to:

* Access your personal data
* Request deletion of your data
* Disconnect financial institutions at any time
* Export your financial data
* Opt out of data collection features

### Account Deletion

If you wish to delete your account and all associated data:

* You can request account deletion through the Settings screen
* Your account will be scheduled for deletion with a 30-day grace period
* During the 30-day period, you can cancel the deletion request at any time
* After 30 days, all your data will be permanently deleted, including:
  - Account information and user profile
  - Financial accounts and balances across all currencies
  - Investment holdings and transaction history
  - Currency preferences and settings
  - Plaid connection tokens and data

This grace period ensures you have sufficient time to reconsider or export your data before permanent deletion.

### Security Measures

We implement multiple security measures:

* End-to-end encryption of sensitive financial data
* Regular security audits
* Secure data transmission protocols
* Anonymization of data where possible
* Multi-factor authentication
* Continuous monitoring for suspicious activities

### Third-Party Services

Our app uses multiple third-party services:

1. **Plaid**: For secure bank connections and account synchronization
2. **Alpha Vantage API**: For cryptocurrency price data
3. **Supabase**: For database and authentication services

Each of these services maintains their own privacy policies which you should review. We only share the minimum data necessary with these services to provide our app functionality.

### Children's Privacy

Our app is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover we have collected personal information from a child under 18, we will delete that information immediately.

### Updates to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top.
